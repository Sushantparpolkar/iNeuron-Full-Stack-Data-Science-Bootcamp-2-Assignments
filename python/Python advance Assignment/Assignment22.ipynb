    "1) Memory Efficiency: The array module is designed to be memory-efficient, which can be particularly useful when dealing with large datasets. It stores data more compactly compared to lists, as it doesn't store additional information like list lengths and object references.\n",
    "2) Performance: Operations on array objects can be faster than equivalent operations on lists because arrays store data in a more contiguous memory block, allowing for better cache utilization and potentially reducing memory access overhead.\n",
