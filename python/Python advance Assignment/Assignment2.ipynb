    "Here are some scenarios where allowing operator overloading can be beneficial:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enhanced functionality: Operator overloading can provide a more natural and expressive way to perform operations on your objects. For example, if you have a custom Vector class, you can overload the + operator to perform vector addition, making your code more readable and intuitive.\n",

    "2. Consistency with built-in types: By overloading operators, you can make your custom classes behave similarly to built-in types. This can improve code readability and reduce the learning curve for users of your class.\n",

    "3. Domain-specific operations: If your class represents a specific domain or concept, operator overloading can allow you to define operations that are specific to that domain. For example, a Matrix class can define the * operator for matrix multiplication, making matrix operations more convenient.\n",

    "4. Simplified syntax: Operator overloading can provide a more concise and natural syntax for performing operations. This can lead to cleaner and more readable code, especially when working with mathematical or symbolic computations.\n",

In Python, classes can be derived from other classes, forming a hierarchy of classes. The derived class (also called a subclass or child class) inherits the properties of the base class (also called a superclass or parent class) and can add its own unique attributes and methods. Inheritance promotes code reuse, modularity, and supports the principle of polymorphism.\n",
