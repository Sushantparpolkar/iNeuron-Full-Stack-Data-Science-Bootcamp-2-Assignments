    "While individual outcomes in a random process may be unpredictable, the overall behavior of the distribution can be described and predicted based on the underlying probabilities. Probability distributions allow us to make statistical inferences and predictions about the likelihood of certain events or ranges of values occurring. These predictions are based on the understanding of the distribution's properties and characteristics."
