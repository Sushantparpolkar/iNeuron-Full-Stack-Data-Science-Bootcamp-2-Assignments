    "Assignment Expressions (Walrus Operator):\n",
    "Python 3.8 introduced the \"walrus operator\" (:=), which allows you to assign a value to a variable as part of an expression. This can be used to simplify code and avoid redundant calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positional-only Parameters:\n",
    "Python 3.8 introduced a syntax to specify positional-only parameters in function definitions. This allows developers to indicate that certain function parameters can only be passed positionally and not as keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "f-strings Improvements:\n",
    "Python 3.8 added support for the \"=\" specifier in f-strings, which allows you to display the value of an expression and its evaluation in an f-string.\n",
    "\n",
    "future Annotations:\n",
    "Python 3.8 introduced the ability to use __future__ annotations to enable or disable certain language features at the module level. This provides better control over how code is interpreted by future Python versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax Warnings:\n",
    "Python 3.8 introduced new syntax warnings to help identify potential code issues or deprecated features.\n",
    "\n",
    "New Syntax Features:\n",
    "Python 3.8 added various new syntax features, including the \"walrus operator,\" the \"=\" specifier in f-strings, and syntax enhancements for dictionary unpacking (**) in literals.\n",
