    "Multiple inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming (OOP) languages that allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from more than one parent class. In other words, a single subclass can have multiple superclasses from which it derives attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional single inheritance, a class can only inherit from one single superclass. However, in languages that support multiple inheritance, a class can inherit from two or more superclasses. This can be useful in scenarios where a class needs to combine features from multiple sources, leading to more flexible and reusable code."
