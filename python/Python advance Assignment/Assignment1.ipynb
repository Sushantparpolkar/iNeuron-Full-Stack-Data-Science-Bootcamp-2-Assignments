    "The purpose of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a way to structure and organize code in a more modular and reusable manner. OOP allows you to define classes, which are blueprint templates for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes, and they encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key purposes of OOP in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modularity: OOP allows you to break down complex systems into smaller, more manageable objects. Each object can have its own data and behavior, making it easier to understand and maintain the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reusability: With OOP, you can create reusable classes that can be instantiated to create multiple objects with similar characteristics. This promotes code reuse and avoids duplicating code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Encapsulation: OOP encapsulates data and methods within objects, hiding the internal implementation details. This provides abstraction and allows objects to interact with each other through well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inheritance: Inheritance allows you to create new classes (derived or child classes) based on existing classes (base or parent classes). This enables code reuse and promotes the concept of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This promotes code flexibility and extensibility by allowing different objects to respond differently to the same method call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, OOP in Python helps in organizing code, improving code reusability, promoting modularity, and making it easier to build complex systems by breaking them down into manageable components."

    "In Python, when you access an attribute of an object, the inheritance search looks for the attribute in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The instance itself: Python first checks if the attribute is present in the instance object. If found, it returns the value associated with the attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The class: If the attribute is not found in the instance object, Python looks for it in the class definition. If found, it returns the value associated with the attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Parent classes (superclasses): If the attribute is not found in the class, Python continues the search in the parent classes, following the order specified by the method resolution order (MRO). The MRO defines the order in which parent classes are traversed during attribute lookup. The MRO is determined by the C3 linearization algorithm, which ensures a consistent and predictable attribute resolution order.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Parent class hierarchy: If the attribute is not found in the immediate parent class, the search continues in the parent class's parent class, and so on, until the attribute is found or the search reaches the topmost class in the hierarchy.\n",

    "5. Object class: If the attribute is not found in any of the parent classes, the search finally reaches the built-in `object` class, which is the ultimate base class for all objects in Python.\n",
