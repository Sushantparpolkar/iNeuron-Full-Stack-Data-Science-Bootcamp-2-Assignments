    " It applies the function to each element of the iterables and returns an iterator that yields the results.\n",
    " \n",
    "Output: map call: The map function returns an iterator. To obtain the actual values, it needs to be converted into a list using the list() function or iterated over using a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionality: map call: The map function is primarily used for applying a function to each element of an iterable. It is suitable for situations where you need to transform each element according to a specific function.\n",

    "\n",
    "Readability: List comprehension: List comprehensions often result in more readable and expressive code. The intention and logic of the transformation are directly visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance: List comprehensions are generally efficient, but they may create an additional temporary list in memory. In cases where memory usage is a concern, using a generator expression instead of a list comprehension can provide memory-efficient lazy evaluation."
